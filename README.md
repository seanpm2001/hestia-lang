# The Hestia Programming Language

A comforting language for me, and maybe for you too.

## Purpose & Goals

The primary goal of Hestia is simply to replace Ruby for scripting, for me (though I doubt I'll ever
stop using Ruby).
I'm aiming for as few dependencies as possible, which means I'll be shaving lots of yaks.

Some planned features maybe:

* Dynamic typing
* Simple, Lisp-like syntax
* Maps as a first-class datatype
* First-class regular expression support
* Immutability by default
* Automatic function currying
* A large, comprehensive standard library
* A first-class REPL

Non-goals:

* Static typing
* Speed
* Safety

Languages that have influenced me over the years:

* Ruby
* Haskell
* Lua
* Clojure
* Racket
* Go
* Elm
* Bash
