# The Hestia Programming Language

A language for me, and maybe for you too.

It doesn't exist yet.

## Why?

Mostly a therapeutic exercise for me to rekindle some love for simple programming.
Also for learning Rust. I'm aiming for as few dependencies as possible, which means
I'll be shaving lots of yaks.

## Purpose & Goals

Although I haven't written Ruby professionally for many years, it's still my go
to "hacking" language. Whenever I need to perform some arithmetic, parse a file,
or grep a website, I open my Ruby REPL (pry). It's a joy.

The primary goal of Hestia is simply to replace Ruby for scripting, for me (though I doubt I'll ever
stop using Ruby). A non-goal is to make a general-purpose language (I don't want
to write webservers in Hestia).
I have written programs in a lot of languages over the years,
and so I'm going to mix features I've come to love and appreciate.

If you want a taste, here are some planned primary features:

* Dynamic typing
* Simple, Lisp-like syntax
* Maps as a first-class datatype
* First-class regular expression support
* Immutability by default
* Automatic function currying
* A "flow" operator
* A large, comprehensive standard library
* A first-class REPL

Other, lower-priority features:

* Abstract data-types (eventually)
* Something like type-classes

**The primary goal is developer (me) happiness.**

Non-goals:

* Static typing
* Speed
* Safety

Languages that have influenced me over the years:

* Ruby
* Haskell
* Lua
* Clojure
* Racket
* Go
* Elm
* Bash
